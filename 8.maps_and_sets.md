### 8. Maps and Sets

#####Â Maps
A collection which maps key value pairs. This means that you don't have to keep creating objects in order to be able to store key value pairs.

```javascript
let cardAce = {
  name: 'Ace of spades'
}

// Create a map
let deck = new Map();
// Add to a map
deck.set('as', cardAce);

// Create and add to a map in one go
let deck = new Map([ ['as', cardAce] ]);
// Find from map
deck.get('as')
// Delete from map
deck.delete('as')
// Delete all key value pairs
deck.clear();

// Iterators
deck.keys();
deck.values()
deck.entries(); // array of key value pairs

// Entries
for (entry of deck) { 
  // do something (note that we don't need to use the .entries() method
}
```

There is also an object called `WeakMap` objects. They hold weak references to entries in the map
* Keys must be reference types (i.e. objects)
* Entries can be garbage collected if these key objects are not being used, freeing up memory
* Cannot be iterated as Javascript cannot know whether each entry will be there or not, or whether some have been garbage collected
* Cannot find the size of a `WeakMap` for the same reason

```javascript
// Continuing from above...
let key1 = {a:1};
let key2 = {a:2};

deck.set(key1, cardAce)
```

##### Sets
A set is a list of unique values.
* Positioning is not important
* There will only ever be 1 or 0 instances of a value
* No such thing as a `.get` method because there can only ever be one at most

```javascript
let set = new Set([1,1,1]); // Because this is a set, it is only considered to have one element in it, 1
set.add(2);
set.delete(1);
set.has(2); // true

for(element of set) {
  console.log(element)
}
```

There is also a `WeakSet` object. It may only store objects with a weak reference to them. 
* Again allows Javascript to clean up unused objects
* No iterator methods
* No size method

```javascript
let set = new WeakSet( {a:1}, {b:2}, {b:2} )
set.has({b:2}) // false! Comparing a new object to ones already in the set
```

Note that the last two objects in the `WeakSet` are *not the same object* - they are different instances of an object and so they have two different reference pointers, and so both reference pointers are considered unique in our `WeakSet`.

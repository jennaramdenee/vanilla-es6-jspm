## 2. Syntax

### Variables
- `let`: Only defined within a block
- `const`: Can not be reassigned (capitalized)

### Functions
- Using fat arrows to define functions and callback functions

```javascript
function fn(*args) {
  // function body
  console.log('hello');
};
```
becomes
```javascript
var fn = (*args) => {
  // function body
  console.log('hello');
};
```
or, if it is one line, it can be contracted further into
```javascript
var fn = (*args) => console.log('hello');
```
which does not even need the return keyword
```javascript
var fn = (*args) => "hello";
console.log(fn());
```

- Fat arrows keep their context when using `this` so it does not need to be bound/assigned to `self` as it will always reference the same thing

```javascript
var fn2 = () => console.log(this)
button.addEventListener('click', fn2)
```

In ES5, the scope of `this` would change to be the button.
In ES6, it keeps context from when it was defined and so would stay as `window`


### Object Literals
```javascript
let name = "Test"
let age = 27;
let locationField = "location";

let obj = {
  "name": "Someone",        // override properties
  age,                      // variable defined outside of obj
  [locationField]: "London" // dynamic property name
  "greet me"() => console.log(this.name + ', ' + this.age + ',' + this.location) // declare a function
}

console.log(obj[locationField]); // returns "London"
```

### 5. Iterators and Generators

##### Iterators
Objects that know how to access values in a collection one at a time (iterable), e.g. Arrays

All `Symbol.iterator`s have a `next` method, which returns a `done` method to indicate when we have finished iterating, a `throw` method to throw an error, `return` to override a return value.

##### Generators
Function which doesn't necessarily run to the end when you execute it. It yields certain (different) values every time you call it.

Indicated by using an asterisk, used via the `yield` keyword.

Generators return iterators, i.e. an object that we can loop, e.g. `select()` below.

```javascript
let obj = {
  [Symbol.iterator]: gen
  // We can delegate responsibility to a generator
  // Good for things like keeping state
}

function *gen() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  //returns an object that we can iterate
  //each iterator object will have next and done methods as above
}

for (let element of obj) {
  console.log(element) // => 1, 2
}
```

## 3. Classes and Modules

### Modules

##### Importing
```javascript
import { keyValue as key, test } from 'moduleName'
import ab from 'moduleName'

console.log(keyValue);
test();
```

Note that `moduleName` does not need its path or `.js` specified.

Here `keyValue` is a reference to the variable `keyValue` defined in the exported file, not a copy of the variable itself.

As `ab` is a default export, we do not need the curly braces. A default export can be imported with any name.

`key` is an alias for `keyValue`.

```javascript
import * as imported from 'moduleName'
```

Allows you to import everything exported in the `moduleName` module. `imported` is an object with a bunch of properties, each property is an export.


##### Exporting
```javascript
let keyValue = 1000;
function test() { console.log('tested'); }
let ab = "some text"

export { keyValue, test };
export default ab;
```
You may only have one `default` export. Here, the `default` word

Modules are always in strict mode. Each module has its own scope.

### Classes

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'name';
  }

  greet() {
    console.log('hello');
  }
}

let person = new Person();
person.greet();
```
`constructor` is a reserved word used to create properties on a class. `person` is a prototype of the `Person` class.


##### Inheritance
```javascript
class Jenna extends Person {
  constructor(age) {
    super(); // call the constructor on the parent class to get access to 'this'
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log('jenna')
  }

  sayHello() {
    this.greet() // calls greet method on Jenna
    super.greet() // calls greet method on Person
  }
}

let jenna = new Jenna(29);
jenna.sayHello();
```

The `extends` keyword can be used for class inheritance.

##### Static methods

```javascript
class Helper {
  static logTwice(message) {
    // do something
  }
}

Helper.logTwice("hello"); // does not need instantiating
```

##### Getters and setters
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name; // private
  }

  get name(){
    // transform or just return a value
  }

  set name(){
    // get value based on some conditions maybe
  }
}

let person = new Person("jenna")
person.name => "jenna" // getter
person.name = "max" // setter
```
Note that this is syntactical and does not actually enforce protection of variables that we define. You could still access the raw variable with `person._name`.

##### Subclasses

Allow you to extend an object.
```javascript
class ConvertableArray extends Array {
  convert(){
    // do some stuff to change the behaviour of built in objects
  }
}
```

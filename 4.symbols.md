### 4. Symbols


##### Unique Symbols
Symbols are unique and primitives in javascript.

```javascript
let symbol = Symbol('debug')
```

Symbol is instantiated just like an Object except without the keyword `new`. 'debug' is only used to identify a symbol when debugging

Symbols are often used with objects.

```javascript
let symbol = Symbol('debug')
let obj = {
  name: 'Jenna',
  [symbol]: 22
}
```

If we `console.log(obj)` it does not surface the symbol, but the symbol property does still exist under the hood so we can `console.log(obj[symbol]) => 22`.

That means we can read that property in one place but not expose it if it doesn't need to get used or modified.


##### Shared symbols
```javascript
let symbol1 = Symbol.for('age')
let symbol2 = Symbol.for('age')
```

`age` is the key used to distinguish the symbol. So two symbols can be created referencing the same key. In this case `symbol1 == symbol2`. If you ever wanted to reassign some value or access a symbol value in a different scope.


##### Well known symbols
Lots of built in symbols. For example..

```javascript
class Person {

}

let person = new Person();
console.log(person) // => [object Object]

Person.prototype[Symbol.toStringTag] = 'Person'
console.log(person) // => [object Person]
```
